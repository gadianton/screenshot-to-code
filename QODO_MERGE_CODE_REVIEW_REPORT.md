## Detailed Code Improvement Recommendations

### ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY - Security Issues

#### 1. Cryptographically Secure Session ID Generation
**File**: `backend/utils.py` (Lines 36-38)  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Importance**: 8/10

**Issue**: The current session ID generation uses basic `random` functions which are not cryptographically secure, potentially leading to session hijacking.

**Current Code**:
```python
def generate_session_id():
    """Generate a simple session ID for tracking user sessions"""
    return ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_letters + string.digits, k=12))
```

**Recommended Fix**:
```python
def generate_session_id():
    """Generate a simple session ID for tracking user sessions"""
    import secrets
    return ''.join(secrets.choices(string.ascii_letters + string.digits, k=12))
```

**Rationale**: Session IDs used for authentication or security purposes must be unpredictable to prevent session hijacking attacks.

#### 2. Strengthen Cache Key Hashing
**File**: `backend/routes/screenshot.py` (Line 68)  
**Impact**: Low  
**Importance**: 5/10

**Issue**: Using MD5 for cache keys creates potential hash collisions and security vulnerabilities.

**Current Code**:
```python
cache_key = hashlib.md5(url.encode()).hexdigest()
```

**Recommended Fix**:
```python
cache_key = hashlib.sha256(f"{url}_{api_key}".encode()).hexdigest()
```

**Rationale**: SHA-256 provides better collision resistance and including additional parameters ensures unique cache keys.

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Concurrency & Race Conditions

#### 3. Fix Concurrent File Access in Metrics Logging
**File**: `backend/llm.py` (Lines 32-41)  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Importance**: 7/10

**Issue**: Multiple requests writing metrics simultaneously can corrupt the data file.

**Current Code**:
```python
if os.path.exists(LLM_METRICS_FILE):
    with open(LLM_METRICS_FILE, "r") as f:
        data = json.load(f)
else:
    data = []

data.append(metrics)

with open(LLM_METRICS_FILE, "w") as f:
    json.dump(data, f)
```

**Recommended Fix**:
```python
import fcntl

try:
    with open(LLM_METRICS_FILE, "r+") as f:
        fcntl.flock(f.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_EX)
        try:
            data = json.load(f)
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            data = []
        data.append(metrics)
        f.seek(0)
        json.dump(data, f)
        f.truncate()
except FileNotFoundError:
    with open(LLM_METRICS_FILE, "w") as f:
        fcntl.flock(f.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_EX)
        json.dump([metrics], f)
```

**Rationale**: File locking prevents race conditions and data corruption when multiple processes access the file simultaneously.

#### 4. Implement Atomic File Writes for User Data
**File**: `backend/user_management.py` (Lines 20-23)  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Importance**: 7/10

**Issue**: User data saving has race conditions that can corrupt the file during concurrent operations.

**Current Code**:
```python
def _save_users(self):
    """Save users to file"""
    with open(USER_DATA_FILE, "w") as f:
        json.dump(self.users, f, indent=2)
```

**Recommended Fix**:
```python
def _save_users(self):
    """Save users to file"""
    import tempfile
    import shutil
    
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', delete=False, suffix='.tmp') as tmp_file:
        json.dump(self.users, tmp_file, indent=2)
        tmp_file.flush()
        os.fsync(tmp_file.fileno())
    
    shutil.move(tmp_file.name, USER_DATA_FILE)
```

**Rationale**: Atomic writes using temporary files prevent data corruption if the process crashes during writing.

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY - Performance & Error Handling

#### 5. Use Async File Operations
**File**: `backend/routes/screenshot.py` (Lines 72-83)  
**Impact**: Low  
**Importance**: 6/10

**Issue**: Synchronous file I/O operations in async functions block the event loop.

**Recommended Fix**:
```python
import aiofiles

# Check if cached version exists
if os.path.exists(cache_file):
    async with aiofiles.open(cache_file, "rb") as f:
        image_bytes = await f.read()
    print(f"Using cached screenshot for {url}")
else:
    image_bytes = await capture_screenshot(url, api_key=api_key)
    
    # Cache the screenshot
    async with aiofiles.open(cache_file, "wb") as f:
        await f.write(image_bytes)
    print(f"Cached new screenshot for {url}")
```

#### 6. Add Error Handling for Cache Operations
**File**: `backend/routes/screenshot.py` (Lines 72-83)  
**Impact**: Low  
**Importance**: 6/10

**Issue**: File operations lack error handling, potentially causing application crashes.

**Recommended Fix**: Wrap file operations in try-catch blocks with appropriate fallback mechanisms.

## Implementation Priority Matrix

| Priority | Issue | File | Impact | Effort |
|----------|-------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Session ID Security | utils.py | High | Low |
| 2 | Metrics File Locking | llm.py | Medium | Medium |
| 3 | User Data Atomic Writes | user_management.py | Medium | Medium |
| 4 | Cache Key Strengthening | screenshot.py | Low | Low |
| 5 | Async File Operations | screenshot.py | Low | Medium |
| 6 | Cache Error Handling | screenshot.py | Low | Low |
