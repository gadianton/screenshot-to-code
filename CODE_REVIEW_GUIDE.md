### üìù Code Quality Review Points

#### File: `backend/llm.py`
- [ ] **Line 22**: Function lacks proper docstring
- [ ] **Line 28**: Magic numbers (file handling) should be constants

#### File: `frontend/src/utils/analytics.ts`
- [ ] **Line 17**: Magic number (100) should be configurable
- [ ] **Line 85**: Console.log statements should use proper logging

#### File: `backend/routes/screenshot.py`

- [ ] **Line 74**: Print statements should use logging framework

## Common Patterns to Look For

### 1. File-Based Storage Patterns
**What to look for**: Direct file operations, JSON storage, no locking
**Files**: `backend/utils.py`, `backend/user_management.py`, `backend/llm.py`
**Questions to ask**:
- Is this the right storage mechanism for production?
- Are there concurrent access issues?
- What happens if the file gets corrupted?

### 2. In-Memory Data Structures
**What to look for**: Global dictionaries, arrays that grow, no cleanup
**Files**: `backend/utils.py`, `frontend/src/store/app-store.ts`
**Questions to ask**:
- What happens when the server restarts?
- Are there memory leak concerns?
- How does this scale with multiple instances?

### 3. Simple Random Generation
**What to look for**: Math.random(), basic string generation
**Files**: `backend/utils.py`, `frontend/src/store/app-store.ts`
**Questions to ask**:
- Is this secure enough for the use case?
- Could there be collisions?
- Should we use a more robust solution?

### 4. Basic Error Handling
**What to look for**: Generic try-catch, console.log errors, toast messages
**Files**: Multiple files
**Questions to ask**:
- Are errors properly categorized?
- Is error information sufficient for debugging?
- Are users getting helpful error messages?

### 5. Hardcoded Values
**What to look for**: Magic numbers, hardcoded file paths, fixed limits
**Files**: Multiple files
**Questions to ask**:
- Should these be configurable?
- Are the values appropriate for all environments?
- Is there documentation explaining the choices?

## Review Questions by Category

### Security Questions
1. Are user inputs properly validated and sanitized?
2. Are file operations secure and properly restricted?
3. Is sensitive data properly protected?
4. Are there any injection vulnerabilities?

### Performance Questions
1. Are there any blocking operations in async contexts?
2. Could any data structures grow unbounded?
3. Are expensive operations properly cached?
4. Are there unnecessary repeated operations?

### Maintainability Questions
1. Is the code well-documented and self-explanatory?
2. Are responsibilities properly separated?
3. Is there excessive code duplication?
4. Are naming conventions consistent?

### Scalability Questions
1. How will this perform with increased load?
2. Are there single points of failure?
3. Can this work with multiple server instances?
4. Are there resource cleanup mechanisms?
